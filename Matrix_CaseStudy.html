                                             <li>Content Organization: Creative Production Agencies often have a diverse portfolio of work and a wide range of services.

                                             <li>Self-imposed Constraints: Challenges in creativity or meet personal goals. I overcame them by creating a design using only black and white colours for the content and glitch effect for the brand logo.</li>
                                             <li>Figma and Design Tool Skills: Faced challenges in Technical skills in figma for doing Prototype, knowledge of design tools like AI image generator, and experience in specific design areas. I overcame them by watching youtube tutorials.Â </li>
